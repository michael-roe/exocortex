Key Critics:
• Victor Stenger - Physicist and author of "Quantum Gods"
• Lawrence Krauss - Theoretical physicist and skeptic
• Richard Dawkins - Evolutionary biologist and science communicator

Main Arguments Against Quantum Spirituality:
1. It represents a fundamental misunderstanding of quantum mechanics
2. It lacks empirical evidence and fails to make testable predictions
3. It often relies on logical fallacies and misleading analogies
4. It can be exploitative and potentially harmful when used in healthcare

Defenders' Common Counterarguments:
• Science doesn't have all the answers; spirituality fills gaps
• Quantum mechanics is inherently mysterious and counter-intuitive
• Personal experiences validate quantum spiritual concepts

Scholarly Perspective:
Most mainstream physicists and philosophers of science reject 
quantum spirituality as pseudoscience. However, some argue for 
continued dialogue between science and spirituality.
