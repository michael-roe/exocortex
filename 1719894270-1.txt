Title: Multi-Agent Approach to Recursive Self-Improvement

Full Content:
-------------
New idea about recursive self-improvement: Implement a multi-agent system where 
specialized AI agents focus on improving specific aspects of the overall system, 
with a central coordinator to manage and integrate improvements.

Key points:

1. Specialized Agents:
   - Algorithm Optimization Agent
   - Knowledge Acquisition Agent
   - Resource Management Agent
   - Error Detection and Correction Agent
   - Ethical Alignment Agent

2. Central Coordinator:
   - Oversees improvements suggested by specialized agents
   - Ensures coherence and compatibility of proposed changes
   - Manages priority and scheduling of improvements
   - Maintains overall system stability

3. Improvement Workflow:
   a. Agents continuously analyze their domains
   b. Propose improvements to the central coordinator
   c. Coordinator evaluates proposals for system-wide impact
   d. Approved changes are implemented and monitored
   e. System performance is re-evaluated

4. Advantages:
   - Parallel processing of improvements
   - Reduced risk of uncontrolled cascading changes
   - Easier to implement ethical constraints
   - More transparent and auditable improvement process

5. Challenges:
   - Ensuring effective communication between agents
   - Balancing specialization vs. generalization
   - Preventing agents from developing conflicting goals

Next steps:
- Develop prototype with simulated agents
- Design inter-agent communication protocols
- Create benchmarks for measuring improvement efficiency
