Key Parallels:
• Both quantum theory and Eastern philosophy challenge classical, 
  deterministic views of reality
• Emphasis on interconnectedness and non-local influences
• Recognition of the role of consciousness in shaping reality
• Concepts of fundamental uncertainty and flux in nature

Notable Proponents:
• Fritjof Capra - "The Tao of Physics"
• Amit Goswami - "The Self-Aware Universe"
• Deepak Chopra - Various works on quantum healing

Criticisms:
• Risk of superficial analogies without deep understanding
• Potential misuse of quantum concepts in spiritual contexts
• Lack of empirical evidence for many claimed connections

Potential Research Directions:
• Neuroquantology - studying quantum effects in consciousness
• Quantum cognition models inspired by Eastern thought
• Investigating meditation effects on quantum coherence
